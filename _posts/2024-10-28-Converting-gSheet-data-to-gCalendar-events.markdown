<h2>Script to automate the creation of Google Calendar Events from a Google Sheet CSV </h2>

# Notes
This Javascript function is designed with a special use case.  I needed a way to convert a 'form response' Google Sheet CSV into events on a Google Calendar.  The sheet has a header row and then each subsequent row has data gathered from a Google Form. 

# Setup
FIXME
