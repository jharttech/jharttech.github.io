<p>While I do not intentionally hunt for certificates, I continually take programs, courses, or classes to continue increasing my skills and understanding of the technology world. If that continual learning happens to add a certificate to go with the knowledge, then why would I not gain the certificate?</p>
<p>This page will be where I keep a running tab of certificates that I have attained. Some hold weight in the industry, while others are for my own achievement</p>
