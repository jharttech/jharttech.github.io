<p>While I do not intentionally hunt certificates, I do continually take programs, courses, or classes to continue increasing my skills and understaning of the technology world.  If that conitnual learning happens to add a certificate to go with the knowledge, then why would I not gain the certificate.</p>
<p>This page will be where I keep a running tab of certificates that I have attanined.  Some hold weight in the industry, others are for my own acheivement.</p>
